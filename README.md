# ‚úâÔ∏è Spring Boot Mailing System

![](src/main/resources/image/logo.png)

Currently, I‚Äôm reengineering the Client-Server Mailing System into a Java 21 Spring Boot 3 REST API to master the Spring ecosystem and Hibernate (JPA) 
with Spring Data JPA, while integrating OAuth2 via Keycloak for user management. It simulates a task-management system featuring user authentication,
role-based access control, and persistent data management.

## üìñ Key focus areas

- **Designing and building a Spring Boot 3 REST API**
- **Hibernate (JPA) with Spring Data JPA for ORM and transactional operations**
- **OAuth2/JWT security using Spring Security and Keycloak (Admin Client & custom role converter)**
- **REST controllers, DTO validation, global exception handling
- **Docker containerization (Dockerfile + Docker Compose) for the application and Keycloak**
- **Unit and integration testing with JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test, MockMvc, and H2 in-memory database**
- **Automatic Database Migrations**: Managing database schema changes using Flyway
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilization of .env file

This project is under active development and will be continuously updated with new features and improvements.
