![](src/main/resources/image/logo.png)

Currently, I‚Äôm reengineering my original Java-based 'Client-Server Mailing System' into a Spring Boot 3 REST API to to master the Spring framework
and Hibernate (JPA) via Spring Data JPA. The new application features OAuth2/JWT authentication through Keycloak, role-based task management endpoints,
and robust data persistence.

## üìñ Key focus areas

- **Designing and building a Spring Boot 3 REST API**
- **Hibernate (JPA) with Spring Data JPA for ORM and transactional operations**
- **OAuth2/JWT security with Spring Security & Keycloak**
- **Keycloak Admin REST client for user & role management**
- **REST controllers, DTO validation, global exception handling**
- **Docker containerization (Dockerfile + Docker Compose) for the application and Keycloak**
- **Unit and integration testing with JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test, MockMvc, and H2 in-memory database**
- **Automatic Database Migrations**
- **Environment Configuration**

This project is under active development and will be continuously updated with new features and improvements.
